Given two strings  **_s_**  and  **_t_**, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in  **_s_**  can be replaced to get  **_t_**.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** **_s_** = `"egg",` **_t =_** `"add"`
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** **_s_** = `"foo",` **_t =_** `"bar"`
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** **_s_** = `"paper",` **_t =_** `"title"`
**Output:** true

**Note:**  
You may assume both  **_s_** and  **_t_** have the same length.
